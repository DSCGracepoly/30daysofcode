# Day 4 Challenge

We are off to day 4 

Todays task will be about fixing typos so go through the "More About The Challenge" in this `README.md`
file and spot/fix some of the typos because it's a more common thing that do happen across some projects documentation.
once spotted and fixed Yeah viola :cocktail: you are on a step to contributing to open source project be it coding, fixing bugs and spotting typos in documentation.  

### More About The Challenge

There are several good reasons you should consider committing to this challenge:

1. Coding will become a daily habit for you — a habit that you can easily maintain after you've finished the
   challenge.

2. Everyday that you consistently code, you’ll build momentum. That momentum will make it easier for you to learn
   more adanced topics. You won’t have to spend extra time trying to remember what you did previously. You can stay
   in the “flow” of coding.

3. The projects that you’ll build will be small in scope, so by the time you finish, you’ll have completed several
   of them — and gained a wide range of experience.

4. Your GitHub profile will look extremey active. And yes, hiring managers and recruites do look at these.

5. You'll have a good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding everyday.

6. You’ll greatly diminish your fear of starting a new coding project. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.
