**Day 19 Challenge**

Day 19 challenge goes like this

    Let's say:

    '(', '{', '[' are called "openers." ')', '}', ']' are called "closers." Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an input string's openers and closers are properly nested.

    Examples: "{ [ ] ( ) }" should return true "{ [ ( ] ) }" should return false "{ [ }" should return false
